# TV Script Generation
In this project, we will generate our own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. We will be using part of the [Seinfeld](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles#scripts.csv) dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network we will build will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.
